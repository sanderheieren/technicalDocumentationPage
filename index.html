      <header>History of Math</header>
      <p>The area of study known as the history of mathematics is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in
      mathematics and, to a lesser extent, an investigation into the mathematical methods and notation of the past. Before the
      modern age and the worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light
      only in a few locales. From 3000 BC the Mesopotamian states of Sumer, Akkad and Assyria, together with Ancient Egypt and
      Ebla began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for purposes of taxation, commerce, trade and also in the patterns in
      nature, the field of astronomy and to record time/formulate calendars.</p>

        <b>Chaos Theory </b> <br>
        
        Chaos Theory is the name mathematicians have come up with to describe the very complex way the world works. Much of
        mathematics invented up until now has been "linear", or related to a line. You could make equations about it, and figure
        out the answer pretty easily.

      <p>What is a Spirograph?
      A Spirograph is formed by rolling a circle inside or outside of another circle. The pen is placed at any point on the
      rolling circle. If the radius of fixed circle is R, the radius of moving circle is r, and the offset of the pen point in
      the moving circle is O, then the equation of the resulting curve is defined by:

      <p>Maze Generator
      
      
      The program generates mazes using three standard algorithms: Depth-first search, Prim's algorithm, and Kruskal's
      algorithm.
      
      
      The Show Gen option will allow you to watch the construction process. Use the scrollbar below the option to control the
      generation speed.</p>
